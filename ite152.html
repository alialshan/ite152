<p> This is how look like the sea wave ,Sea waves are formed due to the movement of air over the ocean's surface, causing water to rise and fall in a rhythmic pattern. These waves can be generated by wind, earthquakes, or underwater landslides, and their size and strength can vary greatly depending on the conditions. As waves travel across the ocean, they carry energy and can have a significant impact on the shorelines they encounter. Surfing, swimming, and boating are some popular activities that take advantage of the power of the sea waves. Despite their beauty and allure, sea waves can also pose a threat to human life and property, particularly during stormy weather conditions.</p><p>
